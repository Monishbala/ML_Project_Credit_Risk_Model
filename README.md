## ðŸŽ¯ Overview  
This project enables real-time prediction of credit risk and loan default probability using user-provided applicant data. Built in Streamlit, it offers a clean, intuitive interface alongside machine learningâ€“based scoring logic and interpretability.

### Core Features  
- Input details such as: Age, Income, Loan Amount, Loan Tenure, Number of Open Accounts, Credit Utilization Ratio, Delinquencies, etc.  
- System computes derived metrics like **loan-to-income ratio** and outputs:  
  - **Default Probability**  
  - **Credit Score**  
  - **Risk Rating** (e.g. Low / Medium / High)  
- Predictions are generated using a trained classification model via `prediction_helper.py`
